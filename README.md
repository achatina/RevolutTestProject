# RevolutTestProject
Test project for Revolut company

Application supports changing rotation, DayNight theme and all other things that common app should do :)

## Main Things:
Build on MVVM architecture with RxJava, Retrofit, Koin, Glide.

List was build with using DiffUtils and Payloads

Images was taken from this llibrary: https://github.com/blongho/worldCountryData

There are lot of possible improvements like UI tests (want to be honestly, I'm not good with them, so didn't include in project), add more tests on Repository and DataSource
Other small issues I mentioned as a comments.
